# Boss-Syntax

This is a derivative of [Bliss Syntax](https://github.com/saadq/bliss-syntax) tweaked to my own personal preference. Feel free to use it but be warned it may change at any time according to my whimsies.

### Installation

```
$ apm install adamphillips/boss-syntax
```

### Setup
1. Go to your `Preferences` and click on `Themes` in the sidebar.
2. Click on the `Syntax Theme` dropdown and change the value to `Boss`.

### Credits
This syntax theme is a lightly tweaked version of [Bliss Syntax](https://github.com/saadq/bliss-syntax) which is in turn is a fork of the awesome [base16-ocean-dark](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) theme created by [Chris Kempson](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16).
